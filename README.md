# Texture Synthesis in PyTorch

This is a PyTorch implementation of the *Texture Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural Networks* paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07376) by Gatys et al. (2015). The code is based on Caffe codebase by the authors of the paper (https://github.com/leongatys/DeepTextures).

## How do I generate my own texture?

## How can I run the code on a GPU?

## What about Mac/Linux?

## How is the model stored?
